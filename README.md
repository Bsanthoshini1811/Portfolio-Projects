# Portfolio-Projects

* In this repository, I added the projects I have done as part of the bootcamp.
* These projects helped me gain the experience and gave me an ease to work with Data Visualization software Tableau.
* In this projects I have done some data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server management studio for working with large datasets.
* Constructing interactive dashboards in Tableau from my findings from the analysis, and publishing them to my profile.
* I have also used Excel a very common software to work with when you are analyzing small datasets, Excel enables you to even visualize your data in charts, and graphs.
